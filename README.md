# polymer-challenge-1 for WEBTECH class

 General  Instructions:  Using  the  existing  template  and  hands-on  exercise  as  your  base  knowledge  in creating a simple Polymer app, create a simple registration view that asks for the user’s first name, last name, and email. For each registered user, create a separate custom view to display their information and add the custom views in the iron-pages and iron-selector modules.
 
 
 Specific Instructions:
 1.   Your first custom view will always be the registration view. The registration view contains a form that asks for the user’s first name, last name and email. You should use a paper-icon-button (Polymer element) as your “REGISTER” button.
 2.   Each added user should update the iron-pages and iron-selector module immediately.  No page refresh should happen.
 3.   You are only allowed to use Javascript, jQuery, Polymer and any custom elements in the Web Components website.
